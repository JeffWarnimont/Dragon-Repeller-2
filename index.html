  <div id="text">Welcome to Dragon Repeller 2. You must defeat the dragon that is preventing people from leaving the town. You are in the town square. You see a store ahead.  There is also an inn that provides healing restoratives.  In the depths of the temple is a cave filled with weak to mid-level monsters.  A powerful dragon blocks the path out of town.</div>
