# Dragon Repeller 2

I expanded upon a game used in a turtorial by Beau Carnes of freecodecamp.org by adding some features and 
fixing some existing ones as a way to refresh myself on Javascript syntax.  I added an inn where the player 
can pay fro healing services, and a purchasable armor set that provides damage reduction and gives a bonus 
if the whole set is owned.  I alsos fixed an issue in the battle math that caused the player to take negative 
damage and raise their health as well as setting a maximum health stat.  

This is a text based RPG with a simple user interface involving clicking buttons to make choices.  Weapons, armor, 
and healing items can be purchased and monsters can be fought to level up your character.  There are meters to keep 
track of health, gold, and experience.  The ultimate goal is to defeat the dragon blocking the way out of town.  You 
will have to taker advantage of all the resources and training to beat the dragon, for if you attack it unprepared 
you will surely die.
